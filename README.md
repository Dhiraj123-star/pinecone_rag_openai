# 🌌 Pinecone RAG OpenAI API

Welcome to the **Pinecone RAG OpenAI API** project! 🚀  
This is a **FastAPI-based web application** that lets you store and search text using vector embeddings powered by **Pinecone** and **OpenAI**.  
Perfect for building **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** applications with ease! 😊

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a simple and intuitive API to:

- **Add Text 📝**: Store text data with embeddings in a Pinecone vector database.
- **Search Text 🔍**: Find similar texts based on a query using semantic search.
- **Reset Index 🧹**: Clear and reinitialize the Pinecone index for fresh starts.

It’s designed for developers and end-users who want to leverage AI-powered text search without complex setup. The API is **user-friendly**, **secure**, and runs **locally** with minimal configuration. 🌐
